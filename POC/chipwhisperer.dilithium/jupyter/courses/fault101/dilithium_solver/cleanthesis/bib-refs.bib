	abstract = {This article describes concrete results and practically validated countermeasures concerning differential fault attacks on RSA using the CRT. We investigate smartcards with an RSA coprocessor where any hardware countermeasures to defeat fault attacks have been switched off. This scenario was chosen in order to analyze the reliability of software countermeasures. We start by describing our laboratory setting for the attacks. Hereafter, we describe the experiments and results of a straightforward implementation of a well-known countermeasure. This implementation turned out to be not sufficient. With the data obtained by these experiments we developed a practical error model. This enabled us to specify enhanced software countermeasures for which we were not able to produce any successful attacks on the investigated chips. Nevertheless, we are convinced that only sophisticated hardware countermeasures (sensors, filters, etc.) in combination with software countermeasures will be able to provide security.},

@inproceedings{rlwe,
	abstract = {The ``learning with errors'' (LWE) problem is to distinguish random linear equations, which have been perturbed by a small amount of noise, from truly uniform ones. The problem has been shown to be as hard as worst-case lattice problems, and in recent years it has served as the foundation for a plethora of cryptographic applications. Unfortunately, these applications are rather inefficient due to an inherent quadratic overhead in the use of LWE. A main open question was whether LWE and its applications could be made truly efficient by exploiting extra algebraic structure, as was done for lattice-based hash functions (and related primitives).},

@article{glwe,
	abstract = {We present a novel approach to fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) that dramatically improves performance and bases security on weaker assumptions. A central conceptual contribution in our work is a new way of constructing leveled, fully homomorphic encryption schemes (capable of evaluating arbitrary polynomial-size circuits of a-priori bounded depth), without Gentry's bootstrapping procedure.Specifically, we offer a choice of FHE schemes based on the learning with error (LWE) or Ring LWE (RLWE) problems that have 2 λ security against known attacks. We construct the following.(1) A leveled FHE scheme that can evaluate depth-L arithmetic circuits (composed of fan-in 2 gates) using O(λ. L3) per-gate computation, quasilinear in the security parameter. Security is based on RLWE for an approximation factor exponential in L. This construction does not use the bootstrapping procedure.(2) A leveled FHE scheme that can evaluate depth-L arithmetic circuits (composed of fan-in 2 gates) using O(λ2) per-gate computation, which is independent of L. Security is based on RLWE for quasipolynomial factors. This construction uses bootstrapping as an optimization.We obtain similar results for LWE, but with worse performance. All previous (leveled) FHE schemes required a per-gate computation of Ω(λ3.5), and all of them relied on subexponential hardness assumptions.We introduce a number of further optimizations to our scheme based on the Ring LWE assumption. As an example, for circuits of large width (e.g., where a constant fraction of levels have width Ω(λ)), we can reduce the per-gate computation of the bootstrapped version to O(λ), independent of L, by batching the bootstrapping operation. At the core of our construction is a new approach for managing the noise in lattice-based ciphertexts, significantly extending the techniques of Brakerski and Vaikuntanathan [2011b].},

@inproceedings{fiatshamirabort,
	abstract = {We demonstrate how the framework that is used for creating efficient number-theoretic ID and signature schemes can be transferred into the setting of lattices. This results in constructions of the most efficient to-date identification and signature schemes with security based on the worst-case hardness of problems in ideal lattices. In particular, our ID scheme has communication complexity of around 65,000 bits and the length of the signatures produced by our signature scheme is about 50,000 bits. All prior lattice-based identification schemes required on the order of millions of bits to be transferred, while all previous lattice-based signature schemes were either stateful, too inefficient, or produced signatures whose lengths were also on the order of millions of bits. The security of our identification scheme is based on the hardness of finding the approximate shortest vector to within a factor of {\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}O{\}}(n^2){\$}in the standard model, while the security of the signature scheme is based on the same assumption in the random oracle model. Our protocols are very efficient, with all operations requiring {\$}{\backslash}tilde{\{}O{\}}(n){\$}time.},

@inproceedings{bliss,
	abstract = {Our main result is a construction of a lattice-based digital signature scheme that represents an improvement, both in theory and in practice, over today's most efficient lattice schemes. The novel scheme is obtained as a result of a modification of the rejection sampling algorithm that is at the heart of Lyubashevsky's signature scheme (Eurocrypt, 2012) and several other lattice primitives. Our new rejection sampling algorithm which samples from a bimodal Gaussian distribution, combined with a modified scheme instantiation, ends up reducing the standard deviation of the resulting signatures by a factor that is asymptotically square root in the security parameter. The implementations of our signature scheme for security levels of 128, 160, and 192 bits compare very favorably to existing schemes such as RSA and ECDSA in terms of efficiency. In addition, the new scheme has shorter signature and public key sizes than all previously proposed lattice signature schemes.},

The design of the scheme avoids all uses of discrete Gaussian sampling and is easily implementable in constant-time. For the same security levels, our scheme has a public key that is 2.5X smaller than the previously most efficient lattice-based schemes that did not use Gaussians, while having essentially the same signature size. In addition to the new design, we significantly improve the running time of the main component of many lattice-based constructions -- the number theoretic transform. Our AVX2-based implementation results in a speed-up of roughly a factor of 2 over the previously best algorithms that appear in the literature. The techniques for obtaining this speed-up also have applications to other lattice-based schemes.},

We provide full-fledged, constant-time portable C implementations consisting of only about 300 lines of C code, which showcases the code compactness of the scheme. Our results also demonstrate that a conservative, provably-secure signature scheme can be efficient and practical, even with a compact and portable implementation. For instance, our C-only implementation executes signing and verification in approximately 0.9 ms on an x64 Intel processor using the proposed level 1 parameter set. Finally, we also provide AVX2-optimized assembly implementations that achieve an additional factor-1.5 speedup.},

@inproceedings{negacyclic,
	abstract = {In the search for post-quantum secure alternatives to RSA and ECC, lattice-based cryptography appears to be an attractive and efficient option. A particularly interesting lattice-based signature scheme is BLISS, offering key and signature sizes in the range of RSA moduli. A range of works on efficient implementations of BLISS is available, and the scheme has seen a first real-world adoption in strongSwan, an IPsec-based VPN suite. In contrast, the implementation-security aspects of BLISS, and lattice-based cryptography in general, are still largely unexplored.At CHES 2016, Groot Bruinderink et al. presented the first side-channel attack on BLISS, thus proving that this topic cannot be neglected. Nevertheless, their attack has some limitations. First, the technique is demonstrated via a proof-of-concept experiment that was not performed under realistic attack settings. Furthermore, the attack does not apply to BLISS-B, an improved variant of BLISS and also the default option in strongSwan. This problem also applies to later works on implementation security of BLISS.In this work, we solve both of the above problems. We present a new side-channel key-recovery algorithm against both the original BLISS and the BLISS-B variant. Our key-recovery algorithm draws on a wide array of techniques, including learning-parity with noise, integer programs, maximimum likelihood tests, and a lattice-basis reduction. With each application of a technique, we reveal additional information on the secret key culminating in a complete key recovery.Finally, we show that cache attacks on post-quantum cryptography are not only possible, but also practical. We mount an asynchronous cache attack on the production-grade BLISS-B implementation of strongSwan. The attack recovers the secret signing key after observing roughly 6000 signature generations.},

	abstract = {We describe new arithmetic coding techniques and side-channel blinding countermeasures for lattice-based cryptography. Using these techniques, we develop a practical, compact, and more quantum-resistant variant of the BLISS Ideal Lattice Signature Scheme. We first show how the BLISS parameters and hash-based random oracle can be modified to be more secure against quantum pre-image attacks while optimizing signature size. Arithmetic Coding offers an information theoretically optimal compression for stationary and memoryless sources, such as the discrete Gaussian distributions often present in lattice-based cryptography. We show that this technique gives better signature sizes than the previously proposed advanced Huffman-based signature compressors. We further demonstrate that arithmetic decoding from an uniform source to target distribution is also an optimal non-uniform sampling method in the sense that a minimal amount of true random bits is required. Performance of this new Binary Arithmetic Coding sampler is comparable to other practical samplers. The same code, tables, or circuitry can be utilized for both tasks, eliminating the need for separate sampling and compression components. We then describe simple randomized blinding techniques that can be applied to anti-cyclic polynomial multiplication to mask timing- and power consumption side-channels in ring arithmetic. We further show that the Gaussian sampling process can also be blinded by a split-and-permute techniques as an effective countermeasure against side-channel attacks.},

	abstract = {In (Micciancio, FOCS 2002), it was proved that solving the generalized compact knapsack problem on the average is as hard as solving certain worst-case problems for cyclic lattices. This result immediately yielded very efficient one-way functions whose security was based on worst-case hardness assumptions. In this work, we show that, while the function proposed by Micciancio is not collision resistant, it can be easily modified to achieve collision resistance under essentially the same complexity assumptions on cyclic lattices. Our modified function is obtained as a special case of a more general result, which yields efficient collision-resistant hash functions based on the worst-case hardness of various new problems. These include new problems from algebraic number theory as well as classic lattice problems (e.g., the shortest vector problem) over ideal lattices, a class of lattices that includes cyclic lattices as a special case.},

A consequence of this, is that most standard ID schemes today are based on the hardness of number theory problems. Not having schemes based on alternate assumptions is a cause for concern since improved number theoretic algorithms or the realization of quantum computing would make the known schemes insecure. In this work, we examine the possibility of creating identification protocols based on the hardness of lattice problems. We construct a 3-move identification scheme whose security is based on the worst-case hardness of the shortest vector problem in all lattices, and also present a more efficient version based on the hardness of the same problem in ideal lattices.},

@article{faultccm,
	abstract = {&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;NIST's post-quantum standardization effort very recently entered its final round. This makes studying the implementation-security aspect of the remaining candidates an increasingly important task, as such analyses can aid in the final selection process and enable appropriately secure wider deployment after standardization. However, lattice-based key-encapsulation mechanisms (KEMs), which are prominently represented among the finalists, have thus far received little attention when it comes to fault attacks.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;Interestingly, many of these KEMs exhibit structural similarities. They can be seen as variants of the encryption scheme of Lyubashevsky, Peikert, and Rosen, and employ the Fujisaki-Okamoto transform (FO) to achieve CCA2 security. The latter involves re-encrypting a decrypted plaintext and testing the ciphertexts for equivalence. This corresponds to the classic countermeasure of computing the inverse operation and hence prevents many fault attacks.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;In this work, we show that despite this inherent protection, practical fault attacks are still possible. We present an attack that requires a single instruction-skipping fault in the decoding process, which is run as part of the decapsulation. After observing if this fault actually changed the outcome (effective fault) or if the correct result is still returned (ineffective fault), we can set up a linear inequality involving the key coefficients. After gathering enough of these inequalities by faulting many decapsulations, we can solve for the key using a bespoke statistical solving approach. As our attack only requires distinguishing effective from ineffective faults, various detection-based countermeasures, including many forms of double execution, can be bypassed.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;We apply this attack to Kyber and NewHope, both of which belong to the aforementioned class of schemes. Using fault simulations, we show that, e.g., 6,500 faulty decapsulations are required for full key recovery on Kyber512. To demonstrate practicality, we use clock glitches to attack Kyber running on a Cortex M4. As we argue that other schemes of this class, such as Saber, might also be susceptible, the presented attack clearly shows that one cannot rely on the FO transform's fault deterrence and that proper countermeasures are still needed.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},

This paper considers factoring integers and finding discrete logarithms, two problems that are generally thought to be hard on classical computers and that have been used as the basis of several proposed cryptosystems. Efficient randomized algorithms are given for these two problems on a hypothetical quantum computer. These algorithms take a number of steps polynomial in the input size, for example, the number of digits of the integer to be factored. },
