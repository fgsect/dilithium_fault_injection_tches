    "**SUMMARY:** *Microcontrollers and FPGAs have a number of operating conditions that must be met in order for the device to work properly. Outside of these conditions, devices will begin to malfunction, with more extreme violations causing the device to stop entirely or even become damaged. By going outside these operating conditions for very small amounts of time, we can cause a varitey of temporary malfunctions*\n",

    "## Clock Glitching Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "Digital hardware devices almost always expect some form of reliable clock. We can manipulate the clock being presented to the device to cause unintended behaviour. We'll be concentrating on microcontrollers here, however other digital devices (e.g. hardware encryption accelerators) can also have faults injected using this technique.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a microcontroller first. The following figure is an excerpt from the Atmel AVR ATMega328P datasheet:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A2_1](img/Mcu-unglitched.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than loading each instruction from FLASH and performing the entire execution, the system has a pipeline to speed up the execution process. This means that an instruction is being decoded while the next one is being retrieved, as the following diagram shows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A2_2](img/Clock-normal.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "But if we modify the clock, we could have a situation where the system doesn't have enough time to actually perform an instruction. Consider the following, where Execute #1 is effectively skipped. Before the system has time to actually execute it another clock edge comes, causing the microcontroller to start execution of the next instruction:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A2_3](img/Clock-glitched.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "This causes the microcontroller to skip an instruction. Such attacks can be immensely powerful in practice. Consider for example the following code from `linux-util-2.24`:\n",

    "### Glitch Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "The ChipWhisperer Glitch system uses the same synchronous methodology as its Side Channel Analysis (SCA) capture. A system clock (which can come from either the ChipWhisperer or the Device Under Test (DUT)) is used to generate the glitches. These glitches are then inserted back into the clock, although it's possible to use the glitches alone for other purposes (i.e. for voltage glitching, EM glitching).\n",
    "\n",
    "The generation of glitches is done with two variable phase shift modules, configured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "![A2_4](img/Glitchgen-phaseshift.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In CW-Husky there is one important difference: the phase shift 1 output is not inverted before it is ANDed with the phase shift 2 output.\n",
    "\n",
    "The enable line is used to determine when glitches are inserted. Glitches can be inserted continuously (useful for development) or triggered by some event. The following figure shows how the glitch can be muxd to output to the Device Under Test (DUT).\n",
    "\n",
    "![A2_5](img/Glitchgen-mux.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware Support: CW-Lite/Pro\n",
    "\n",
    "The phase shift blocks use the Digital Clock Manager (DCM) blocks within the FPGA. These blocks have limited support for run-time configuration of parameters such as phase delay and frequency generation, and for maximum performance the configuration must be fixed at design time. The Xilinx-provided run-time adjustment can shift the phase only by about +/- 5nS in 30pS increments (exact values vary with operating conditions).\n",
    "\n",
    "For most operating conditions this is insufficient - if attacking a target at 7.37MHz the clock cycle would have a period of 136nS. In order to provide a larger adjustment range, an advanced FPGA feature called Partial Reconfiguration (PR) is used. The PR system requires special partial bitstreams which contain modifications to the FPGA bitstream. These are stored as two files inside a \"firmware\" zip which contains both the FPGA bitstream along with a file called `glitchwidth.p` and a file called `glitchoffset.p`. If a lone bitstream is being loaded into the FPGA (i.e. not from the zip-file), the partial reconfiguration system is disabled, as loading incorrect partial reconfiguration files could damage the FPGA. This damage is mostly theoretical, more likely the FPGA will fail to function correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "If in the course of following this tutorial you find the FPGA appears to stop responding (i.e. certain features no longer work correctly), it could be the partial reconfiguration data is incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at how to interface with these features later in the tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware Support: CW-Husky\n",
    "\n",
    "The clock-generation logic in Husky's 7-series FPGA is considerably different than the 6-series FPGAs used in CW-Lite/Pro. The DCM is gone and replaced by the much more powerful (and power hungry...) Mixed Mode Clock Manager (MMCM). In particular for our glitching application, MMCMs allow fine phase shift adjustments over an unlimited range, in steps as small as 15ps. And all this without having to dynamically reconfigure the FPGA bitfile! For this reason, the format for specifying the glitch offset and width is different from what it was for CW-Lite/Pro. Instead of specifiying a percentage of the source clock period, you now specify the actual number of phase shift steps. The duration of one phase shift step is 1/56 of the MMCM VCO clock period, which can itself be configured to be anyhwere in the range from 600 MHz to 1200 MHz (via `scope.clock.pll.update_fpga_vco()`).\n",
    "\n",
    "While the MMCM is more powerful than the DCM with respect to its features, it also requires a lot more power. For this reason, the glitch generation circuitry is disabled by default and must be explicitly turned on. Fear not, Husky also uses Xilinx's XADC module to continuously monitor its temperature, and all MMCMs are automatically turned off at when the temperature starts getting too high, well below dangerous levels are reached (run `scope.XADC` to see all its statistics and settings).\n"

    "\n",
    "### Repeat\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab used a pretty large repeat value. Like the name suggests, this setting controls how many times the glitch is repeated (i.e. a repeat value of 5 will place glitches in 5 consecutive clock cycles). Consider that each glitch inserted has a chance to both cause a glitch or crash the device. This was pretty advantageous for this lab since we had a lot of different spots we wanted to place a glitch - using a high repeat value increased our chance for a crash, but also increased our chance for a successful glitch. For an attack where we're targeting a single instruction, we don't really increase our glitch chance at all, but still have the increased crash risk. Worse yet, a successful glitch in a wrong spot may also cause a crash! It is for that reason that it's often better to use a low repeat value when targeting a single instruction.\n",

    "### Ext Offset\n",
    "\n",
    "The ext offset setting controls a delay between the trigger firing and the glitch being inserted. Like repeat, it's based on whole clock cycles, meaning an ext offset of 10 will insert a glitch 10 cycles after the trigger fires. We didn't have to worry about this setting for this lab since the large repeat value was able to take us into the area we wanted. This won't be true for many applications, where you'll have to try glitches at a large variety of ext_offsets.\n",
